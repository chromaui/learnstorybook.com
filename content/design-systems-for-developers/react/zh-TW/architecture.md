description: 'How to extract a design system from component libraries'
commit: 15d81f7
---

In chapter 2, we extract a design system from existing component libraries. Along the way, we determine which components belong in the design system and outline common challenges developers face getting started.

In large companies, this exercise is done in conjunction with design, engineering, and product teams. Chromatic (the company behind Storybook) and Storybook share a sprightly frontend infrastructure team that serves nearly 800 open source contributors across 3+ properties, so we‚Äôre going to outline the process for you.

## The challenge

If you work on a development team, you‚Äôve probably noticed that bigger teams aren‚Äôt very efficient. Miscommunication is rampant as teams grow. Existing UI patterns go undocumented or are lost altogether. That means developers reinvent the wheel instead of building new features. Over time, projects are littered with one-off components.

We slammed into this predicament. Despite the best intentions of an experienced team, UI components were endlessly rebuilt or pasted into place. UI patterns that were supposed to be the same diverged in appearance and functionality. Each component was a unique snowflake which made it impossible for new developers to discern the source of truth, much less contribute.

## Create a design system

A design system consolidates common UI components in a central well-maintained repository that gets distributed via a package manager. Developers import standardized UI components instead of pasting the same UI code in multiple projects.

Most design systems aren‚Äôt built from scratch. Instead, they‚Äôre assembled from tried-and-true UI components used across a company which are repackaged as a design system. Our project is no exception. We‚Äôll cherry-pick components from existing production component libraries to save time and deliver our design system to stakeholders faster.

## Where does the design system live?

You can think of a design system as another component library, but instead of servicing one app, it serves an entire organization. A design system focuses on UI primitives while project-specific component libraries can contain anything from composite components to screens.

As such, our design system must be independent of any project and also a dependency of all projects. Changes propagate throughout the organization via a versioned package distributed by a package manager. Projects can reuse design system components and further customize if needed. These constraints give us the blueprint for organizing our frontend projects.

## Setup our repository with create-react-app and GitHub

React is the most popular view layer according to the [State of JS](https://stateofjs.com/) survey. An overwhelming number of Storybooks use React, so we‚Äôre using it in this tutorial along with the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) boilerplate.

In your command line run the following commands:

```shell
# Clone the files
npx degit chromaui/learnstorybook-design-system-template learnstorybook-design-system

cd learnstorybook-design-system

# Install the dependencies
yarn install
```

<div class="aside">
üí° We use <a href="https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit">degit</a> to download folders from GitHub. If you want to do it manually, you can grab the contents <a href="https://github.com/chromaui/learnstorybook-design-system/tree/setup">here</a>.
</div>

Once the files and dependencies are installed, we can push it to GitHub (which we‚Äôll use to host the code for our design system). Start by signing in and creating a new repository on GitHub.com:

![Create a GitHub repository](/design-systems-for-developers/create-github-repository.png)

Then follow GitHub's instructions to setup the (the so-far mostly empty) repository:

```shell
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/learnstorybook-design-system.git
git push -u origin main
```

Be sure to replace `your-username` with your own account name.

## What belongs and what doesn‚Äôt

Design systems should only contain pure and [presentational components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0). These components deal with how UI appears. They respond exclusively to props, do not contain app-specific business logic, and are agnostic to how data loads. These properties are essential in allowing the component to be reusable.

Design systems aren‚Äôt the superset of every component library in an organization. That would be a headache to keep track of.

App-specific components that contain business logic should not be included because that hamstrings reuse by requiring consumer projects to have identical business constraints.

Omit one-offs that aren‚Äôt currently being reused. Even if you hope they become part of the design system one day, nimble teams avoid maintaining excess code when possible.

## Create an inventory

The first task is creating an inventory of your components to identify the most used. This often involves manually cataloging screens in various web sites or apps to discern common UI patterns. Designers like [Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/interface-inventory/) and [Nathan Curtis](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/the-component-cut-up-workshop-1378ae110517) have published handy methodologies for inventorying components so we won‚Äôt go into further detail in this tutorial.

Useful heuristics for developers:

- If a UI pattern is used more than three times, turn it into a reusable UI component.
- If a UI component is used in 3 or more projects/teams, put it in your design system.

![Contents of a design system](/design-systems-for-developers/design-system-grid.png)

Following this method, we end up with UI primitives: Avatar, Badge, Button, Checkbox, Input, Radio, Select, Textarea, Highlight (for code), Icon, Link, Tooltip, and more. These building blocks are configured in different ways to assemble countless unique features and layouts in our client apps.

<p>
For the code sample, we‚Äôve selected a subset of these components to make reasoning about the repository simpler. Some teams also include customized third-party components in their design systems for other components like Tables and Forms.</p></div>

<div class="aside">üí° CSS-in-JS: We use <a href="https://www.styled-components.com">styled-components</a>, a library that allows us to scope styling to the component. There are other valid methods to style components including targeting classes manually, CSS modules, etc.</div>

In addition to UI components, it makes sense to include styling constants for typography, colors, spacing, etc that are reused across projects. In design system nomenclature global style variables are called ‚Äúdesign tokens‚Äù. We won‚Äôt dive into the theory behind design tokens in this guide, but you can learn more online (here‚Äôs a [good article](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/tokens-in-design-systems-25dd82d58421)).

## Let‚Äôs start developing

We‚Äôve defined what to build and how it fits together, it‚Äôs time to get to work. In chapter 3 we‚Äôll scaffold the fundamental tooling for design systems. Our raw directory of UI components will be cataloged and viewable with help from Storybook.
