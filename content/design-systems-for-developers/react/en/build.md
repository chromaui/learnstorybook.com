In chapter 3, we‚Äôll set up the essential design system tooling starting with Storybook, the most popular component explorer. The goal of this guide is to show you how professional teams build design systems, so we‚Äôll also focus on finer details like the code hygiene, timesaving Storybook addons, and directory structure.

## Code formatting and linting for hygiene

Design systems are collaborative, so tools that fix syntax and standardize formatting serve to improve contribution quality. Enforcing code consistency with tooling is much less work than policing code by hand, a benefit for the resourceful design system author.

In this tutorial, we'll use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as our editor, but you can apply the same principles to other modern editors like [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), or [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

To ensure a consistent code style, we will be utilizing [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). This code formatter is widely used and supports multiple languages. It seamlessly integrates with most editors, including the one we are using, and was included in the template we cloned earlier in this guide when we initialized our design system. If you are a first-time user of Prettier, you may need to configure it for your editor. For VSCode, install the Prettier addon.

![Prettier addon for VSCode](/design-systems-for-developers/prettier-addon.png)

Enable the Format on Save `editor.formatOnSave` if you haven‚Äôt done so already. Once you‚Äôve installed Prettier, you should find that it auto-formats your code whenever you save a file.

## Install Storybook

Storybook is the industry-standard [component explorer](https://www.chromatic.com/blog/ui-component-explorers---your-new-favorite-tool) for developing UI components in isolation. Since design systems focus on UI components, Storybook is the ideal tool for the use case. We‚Äôll rely on these features:

- üìïCatalog UI components
- üìÑSave component variations as stories
- ‚ö°Ô∏èDeveloper experience tooling like Hot Module Reloading
- üõ†Supports many view layers, including React

Install and run Storybook with the following commands:

```shell:clipboard=false
# Installs Storybook
npx storybook@latest init

# Starts Storybook in development mode
yarn storybook
```

You should see this:

![Initial Storybook UI](/design-systems-for-developers/storybook-initial-7-0.png)

Nice, we‚Äôve set up a component explorer!

Every time you install Storybook into an application, it will add some examples inside the `stories` folder. If you want, take some time and explore them. But we won't be needing them for our design system, so it's safe to delete the `stories` directory.

Now your Storybook should look like this (notice that the font styles are a little off, for instance, see the "Avatar: Initials" story):

  <source
    src="/design-systems-for-developers/storybook-initial-stories-without-styles-7-0.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />

### Add global styles

Our design system requires some global styles (a CSS reset) to be applied to the document to render our components correctly. We can add them easily with Emotion's [global style prop](https://emotion.sh/docs/globals). Update your `src/shared/global.js` file to the following:

```diff:title=src/shared/global.js
import { css } from '@emotion/react';

import { color, typography } from './styles';

+ export const fontUrl = 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Nunito+Sans:400,700,800,900';

export const bodyStyles = css`
  /* Same as before */
`;

export const GlobalStyle = css`
  body {
    ${bodyStyles}
  }
`;
```

To use the `Global` ‚Äúcomponent‚Äù in Storybook, we can make use of a [decorator](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/decorators) (a component wrapper). In an app, we‚Äôd place that component in the top-level app layout, but in Storybook, we wrap all stories using the preview config file [`.storybook/preview.js`](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/overview#configure-story-rendering). Rename the file to `.storybook/preview.jsx` and update it to the following:

```diff:title=.storybook/preview.jsx
+ import { Global } from '@emotion/react';

+ import { GlobalStyle } from '../src/shared/global';

/** @type { import('@storybook/react').Preview } */
const preview = {
+ decorators: [
+   (Story) => (
+     <>
+       <Global styles={GlobalStyle} />
+       <Story />
+     </>
+   ),
+ ],
  parameters: {
    actions: { argTypesRegex: '^on[A-Z].*' },
    controls: {
      matchers: {
        color: /(background|color)$/i,
        date: /Date$/,
      },
    },
  },
};

export default preview;
```

<div class="aside">üí° The <code><></code> in the decorator is not a typo--it‚Äôs a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html">React Fragment</a> that we use here to avoid adding an unnecessary extra HTML tag to our output.</div>

The decorator ensures the `GlobalStyle` renders no matter which story is selected.

## Supercharge Storybook with addons

Storybook includes a powerful [addon ecosystem](https://storybook.js.org/addons) created by a massive community. For the pragmatic developer, it‚Äôs easier to build our workflow using the ecosystem instead of creating custom tooling ourselves (which can be time-consuming).

<h4 id="storybook-addon-actions">Actions addon to verify interactivity</h4>

The [actions addon](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/actions) gives you UI feedback in Storybook when an action is performed on an interactive element like a Button or Link. Actions comes installed in Storybook by default, and you use it simply by passing an ‚Äúaction‚Äù as a callback prop to a component.

Let‚Äôs see how to use it in our Button element, which optionally takes a wrapper component to respond to clicks. We have a story that passes an action to that wrapper:

```jsx:title=src/Button/Button.stories.jsx
import styled from '@emotion/styled';

import { Button } from './Button';

import { Icon } from '../Icon/Icon';

import { StoryLinkWrapper } from '../LinkWrapper';

// When the user clicks a button, it will trigger the `action()`,
// ultimately showing up in Storybook's addon panel.
function ButtonWrapper(props) {
  return <CustomButton {...props} />;
}

export const buttonWrapper = {
  name: 'button wrapper',
  render: () => (
    <div>
      <ButtonWrapper>Original Button Wrapper</ButtonWrapper>
      <br />
      <Button ButtonWrapper={ButtonWrapper} appearance='primary'>
        Primary
      </Button>
      /* Removed for brevity */
    </div>
  ),
};
```

<h4 id="storybook-addon-controls">Controls to stress test components</h4>

Fresh installs of Storybook include the [Controls addon](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls) already configured out of the box.

It allows you to interact with component inputs (props) dynamically in the Storybook UI. You can supply multiple values to a component prop through [arguments](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/args) (or args for short) and adjust them through the UI. It helps design systems creators stress test component inputs (props) by adjusting the argument's values. It also gives design systems consumers the ability to try components before integrating them to understand how each input (prop) affects them.

Let's see how they work by adding a new story in the `Avatar` component, located in `src/Avatar/Avatar.stories.jsx`:

```jsx:title=src/Avatar/Avatar.stories.jsx
import { Avatar } from './Avatar';

export default {
  title: 'Design System/Avatar',
  component: Avatar,
  /*
   * More on Storybook argTypes at:
   * https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/argtypes
   */
  argTypes: {
    size: {
      control: {
        type: 'select',
      },
      options: ['tiny', 'small', 'medium', 'large'],
    },
  },
};

// Other Avatar stories

/*
 * New story using Controls
 * Read more about Storybook templates at:
 * https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/introduction#using-args
 */
export const Controls = {
  args: {
    loading: false,
    size: 'tiny',
    username: 'Dominic Nguyen',
    src: 'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/263385',
  },
};
```

Notice the Controls tab in the addon panel. Controls automatically generates graphical UI to adjust props. For instance, the ‚Äúsize‚Äù select element allows us to cycle through the supported Avatar sizes `tiny`, `small`, `medium`, and `large`. The same was applied to the remainder component's props (‚Äúloading‚Äù, ‚Äúusername‚Äù, and ‚Äúsrc‚Äù), allowing us to create a user-friendly way to stress test components.

    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

That said, Controls don‚Äôt replace stories. They are great for exploring the edge cases of the components and stories for showcasing the assumed states.

We'll visit the Accessibility and Docs addons in later chapters.

## Learn how to automate maintenance

Now that our design system components are in Storybook, we've taken one more step to create an industry-standard design system. Now it's an excellent time to commit our work to our remote repository. Then we can start thinking about how we set up the automated tooling that streamlines ongoing maintenance.

A design system, like all software, should evolve. The challenge is to ensure UI components continue to look and feel as intended as the design system grows.

In chapter 4, we‚Äôll learn how to set up continuous integration and auto-publish the design system online for collaboration.
