![Design System example](/design-systems-for-developers/design-system-overview.jpg)

Follow along as we code a design system that's inspired by [Storybook's own](https://medium.com/storybookjs/introducing-storybook-design-system-23fd9b1ac3c0). We'll learn the developer perspective on design systems by examining three technical pieces of a design system.

- üèó Common reusable UI components
- üé® Design tokens: Styling-specific variables such as brand colors and spacing
- üìï Documentation site: Usage instructions, narrative, do‚Äôs and don'ts

After that, we'll set up the industrial-grade infrastructure for review, testing, documentation, and distribution.
