Last chapter we built our first component; this chapter extends what we learned to build TaskList, a list of Tasks. Let’s combine components together and see what happens when more complexity is introduced.

## Tasklist

Taskbox emphasizes pinned tasks by positioning them above default tasks. This yields two variations of `TaskList` you need to create stories for: default items and default and pinned items.

Since `Task` data can be sent asynchronously, we **also** need a loading state to render in the absence of a connection. In addition, an empty state is required when there are no tasks.

## Get setup

A composite component isn’t much different than the basic components it contains. Create a `TaskList` component and an accompanying story file: `src/components/TaskList.svelte` and `src/components/TaskList.stories.js`.

Start with a rough implementation of the `TaskList`. You’ll need to import the `Task` component from earlier and pass in the attributes and actions as inputs.

```html
<!--src/components/TaskList.svelte-->

<script>
  import Task from './Task.svelte';
  export let loading = false;
  export let tasks = [];

  // reactive declarations (computed prop in other frameworks)
  $: noTasks = tasks.length === 0;
  $: emptyTasks = tasks.length === 0 && !loading;
</script>
{#if loading}
  <div class="list-items">loading</div>
{/if}
{#if emptyTasks}
  <div class="list-items">empty</div>
{/if} 
{#each tasks as task}
  <Task {task} on:onPinTask on:onArchiveTask />
{/each}
```


Next create `Tasklist`’s test states in the story file.

```javascript
// src/components/TaskList.stories.js
import TaskList from "./TaskList.svelte";
import { taskData, actionsData } from "./Task.stories";
export default {
  title: "TaskList",
  excludeStories: /.*Data$/
};

export const defaultTasksData = [
  { ...taskData, id: "1", title: "Task 1" },
  { ...taskData, id: "2", title: "Task 2" },
  { ...taskData, id: "3", title: "Task 3" },
  { ...taskData, id: "4", title: "Task 4" },
  { ...taskData, id: "5", title: "Task 5" },
  { ...taskData, id: "6", title: "Task 6" }
];
export const withPinnedTasksData = [
  ...defaultTasksData.slice(0, 5),
  { id: "6", title: "Task 6 (pinned)", state: "TASK_PINNED" }
];

// default TaskList state
export const Default = () => ({
  Component: TaskList,
   props: {
    tasks: defaultTasksData
  },
  on: {
    ...actionsData
  }
});
// tasklist with pinned tasks
export const WithPinnedTasks = () => ({
  Component: TaskList,
  props: {
    tasks: withPinnedTasksData
  },
  on: {
    ...actionsData
  }
});
// tasklist in loading state
export const Loading = () => ({
  Component: TaskList,
  props: {
    loading: true
  },
});
// tasklist no tasks
export const Empty = () => ({
  Component: TaskList,
}); 
```

`taskData` supplies the shape of a `Task` that we created and exported from the `Task.stories.js` file. Similarly, `actionsData` defines the actions (mocked callbacks) that a `Task` component expects, which the `TaskList` also needs.

Now check Storybook for the new `TaskList` stories.

## Build out the states

Our component is still rough but now we have an idea of the stories to work toward. You might be thinking that the `.list-items` wrapper is overly simplistic. You're right – in most cases we wouldn’t create a new component just to add a wrapper. But the **real complexity** of `TaskList` component is revealed in the edge cases `withPinnedTasks`, `loading`, and `empty`.

For the loading edge case, we're going to create a new component that will display the correct markup.

Create a new file called `LoadingRow.svelte` and inside add the following markup:

```html
<!--src/components/LoadingRow.svelte-->
<div class="loading-item">
  <span class="glow-checkbox" />
  <span class="glow-text">
    <span>Loading</span>
    <span>cool</span>
    <span>state</span>
  </span>
</div>
```

And update `TaskList.svelte` to the following:

```html
<!--src/components/TaskList.svelte-->

<script>
  import Task from './Task.svelte';
  import LoadingRow from './LoadingRow.svelte';
  export let loading = false;
  export let tasks = [];

  // reactive declaration (computed prop in other frameworks)
  $: noTasks = tasks.length === 0;
  $: emptyTasks = tasks.length === 0 && !loading;
  $: tasksInOrder = [
    ...tasks.filter(t => t.state === 'TASK_PINNED'),
    ...tasks.filter(t => t.state !== 'TASK_PINNED'),
  ];
</script>
{#if loading}
<div class="list-items">
  <LoadingRow />
  <LoadingRow />
  <LoadingRow />
  <LoadingRow />
  <LoadingRow />
</div>
{/if} 
{#if tasks.length === 0 && !loading}
<div class="list-items">
  <div class="wrapper-message">
    <span class="icon-check" />
    <div class="title-message">You have no tasks</div>
    <div class="subtitle-message">Sit back and relax</div>
  </div>
</div>
{/if} 
{#each tasksInOrder as task}
  <Task {task} on:onPinTask on:onArchiveTask />
{/each}
```

The added markup results in the following UI:

<video autoPlay muted playsInline loop>
  <source
    src="/intro-to-storybook/finished-tasklist-states.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

Note the position of the pinned item in the list. We want the pinned item to render at the top of the list to make it a priority for our users.

## Automated testing

In the previous chapter we learned how to snapshot test stories using Storyshots. With `Task` there wasn’t a lot of complexity to test beyond that it renders OK. Since `TaskList` adds another layer of complexity we want to verify that certain inputs produce certain outputs in a way amenable to automatic testing. To do this we’ll create unit tests using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) coupled with a test renderer.

![Jest logo](/intro-to-storybook/logo-jest.png)

### Unit tests with Jest

Storybook stories paired with manual visual tests and snapshot tests (see above) go a long way to avoiding UI bugs. If stories cover a wide variety of component use cases, and we use tools that ensure a human checks any change to the story, errors are much less likely.

However, sometimes the devil is in the details. A test framework that is explicit about those details is needed. Which brings us to unit tests.

In our case, we want our `TaskList` to render any pinned tasks **before** unpinned tasks that it has passed in the `tasks` prop. Although we have a story (`WithPinnedTasks`) to test this exact scenario, it can be ambiguous to a human reviewer that if the component **stops** ordering the tasks like this, it is a bug. It certainly won’t scream **“Wrong!”** to the casual eye.

So, to avoid this problem, we can use Jest to render the story to the DOM and run some DOM querying code to verify salient features of the output.

Create a test file called `src/components/TaskList.test.js`. Here, we’ll build out our tests that make assertions about the output.

```javascript
// src/components/TaskList.test.js
import TaskList from './TaskList.svelte';
import { render } from '@testing-library/svelte';
import { withPinnedTasksData } from './TaskList.stories'
test('TaskList ', async () => {
  const { container } = await render(TaskList, {
    props: {
      tasks: withPinnedTasksData,
    },
  });
  expect(container.firstChild.children[0].classList.contains('TASK_PINNED')).toBe(true);
});
```

![TaskList test runner](/intro-to-storybook/tasklist-testrunner.png)

Note that we’ve been able to reuse the `withPinnedTasksData` list of tasks in both story and unit test; in this way we can continue to leverage an existing resource (the examples that represent interesting configurations of a component) in many ways.

Notice as well that this test is quite brittle. It's possible that as the project matures, and the exact implementation of the `Task` changes --perhaps using a different classname or a `textarea` rather than an `input`--the test will fail, and need to be updated. This is not necessarily a problem, but rather an indication to be careful about liberally using unit tests for UI. They're not easy to maintain. Instead rely on visual, snapshot, and visual regression (see [testing chapter](/svelte/en/test/)) tests where possible.
