![Taskbox UI](/ss-browserchrome-taskbox-learnstorybook.png)

Taskbox, a task management UI (similar to Asana), complete with multiple item types and states. We'll go from building simple UI components to assembling screens. Each chapter illustrates a different aspect of developing UIs with Storybook.

ðŸ“– Each chapter is linked to a working commit to help you stay in sync.
