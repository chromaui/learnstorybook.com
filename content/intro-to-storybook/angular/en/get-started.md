Storybook runs alongside your app in development mode. It helps you build UI components isolated from the business logic and context of your app. This edition of the Intro to Storybook tutorial is for Angular; other editions exist for [React](/intro-to-storybook/react/en/get-started), [React Native](/intro-to-storybook/react-native/en/get-started), [Vue](/intro-to-storybook/vue/en/get-started), [Svelte](/intro-to-storybook/svelte/en/get-started) and [Ember](/intro-to-storybook/ember/en/get-started).

## Setup Angular Storybook

We'll need to follow a few steps to get the build process set up in our environment. To start with, we want to use [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) to setup our build system. Using this package, you can download "templates" (partially built applications with some default configuration) to help you fast track your development workflow.

Letâ€™s run the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the template
npx degit chromaui/intro-storybook-angular-template taskbox

cd taskbox

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

<div class="aside">
ðŸ’¡ This template contains the necessary styles, assets and bare essential configurations for this version of the tutorial.
</div>

Now we can quickly check that the various environments of our application are working properly:

```bash
# Run the test runner (Jest) in a terminal:
npm run test

# Start the component explorer on port 6006:
npm run storybook

# Run the frontend app proper on port 4200:
npm run start
```

Our three frontend app modalities: automated test (Jest), component development (Storybook), and the app itself.

Depending on what part of the app youâ€™re working on, you may want to run one or more of these simultaneously. Since our current focus is creating a single UI component, weâ€™ll stick with running Storybook.

## Commit changes

At this stage it's safe to add our files to a local repository. Run the following commands to initialize a local repository, add and commit the changes we've done so far.

```shell
$ git init
```

Followed by:

```shell
$ git branch -M main
```

Then:

```shell
$ git add .
```

And finally:

```shell
$ git commit -m "first commit"
```

Let's start building our first component!
