Last chapter we built our first component; this chapter extends what we learned to build TaskList, a list of Tasks. Let‚Äôs combine components together and see what happens when more complexity is introduced.

## Tasklist

Taskbox emphasizes pinned tasks by positioning them above default tasks. This yields two variations of `TaskList` you need to create stories for: default items and default and pinned items.

Since `Task` data can be sent asynchronously, we **also** need a loading state to render in the absence of a connection. In addition, an empty state is required when there are no tasks.

![empty and loading tasks](/intro-to-storybook/tasklist-states-2.png)

## Get setup

A composite component isn‚Äôt much different than the basic components it contains. Create a `TaskList` template and an accompanying story file: `app/components/task-list.hbs` and `app/components/task-list.stories.js`.

Start with a rough implementation of the `TaskList`. You‚Äôll need to import the `Task` component from earlier and pass in the attributes and actions as inputs.

```handlebars:title=app/components/task-list.hbs
{{#if @loading}}
 <div class="list-items">loading</div>>
{{else if @tasks}}
  {{#each @tasks as |task|}}
    <Task
      @task={{task}}
      @pin={{fn @pinTask task.id}}
      @archive={{fn @archiveTask task.id}}
    />
  {{/each}}
{{else}}
  <div class="list-items">
    empty
  </div>
{{/if}}
```

Next create `Tasklist`‚Äôs test states in the story file.

```js:title=app/components/task-list.stories.js
import { hbs } from 'ember-cli-htmlbars';

import * as TaskStories from './task.stories';

export default {
  title: 'TaskList',
  component: 'TaskList',
};

const Template = args => ({
  template: hbs`
    <div style="margin: 3em">
      <TaskList
        @tasks={{this.tasks}}
        @pinTask={{fn this.onPinTask}}
        @archiveTask={{fn this.onArchiveTask}}
        @loading={{this.loading}}/>
    </div>`,
  context: args,
});

export const Default = Template.bind({});
Default.args = {
  // Shaping the stories through args composition.
  // The data was inherited from the Default story in task.stories.js.
  tasks: [
    { ...TaskStories.Default.args.task, id: '1', title: 'Task 1' },
    { ...TaskStories.Default.args.task, id: '2', title: 'Task 2' },
    { ...TaskStories.Default.args.task, id: '3', title: 'Task 3' },
    { ...TaskStories.Default.args.task, id: '4', title: 'Task 4' },
    { ...TaskStories.Default.args.task, id: '5', title: 'Task 5' },
    { ...TaskStories.Default.args.task, id: '6', title: 'Task 6' },
  ],
  ...TaskStories.actionsData,
};

export const WithPinnedTasks = Template.bind({});
WithPinnedTasks.args = {
  // Shaping the stories through args composition.
  // Inherited data coming from the Default story.
  ...Default.args,
  tasks: [
    ...Default.args.tasks.slice(0, 5),
    { id: '6', title: 'Task 6 (pinned)', state: 'TASK_PINNED' },
  ],
};

export const Loading = Template.bind({});
Loading.args = {
  tasks: [],
  loading: true,
};

export const Empty = Template.bind({});
Empty.args = {
  ...Loading.args,
  loading: false,
};
```

By importing `TaskStories`, we were able to [compose](https://storybook.js.org/docs/ember/writing-stories/args#args-composition) the arguments (args for short) in our stories with minimal effort. That way the data and actions (mocked callbacks) expected by both components is preserved.

Now check Storybook for the new `TaskList` stories.

## Build out the states

Our component is still rough but now we have an idea of the stories to work toward. You might be thinking that the `.list-items` wrapper is overly simplistic. You're right ‚Äì in most cases we wouldn‚Äôt create a new component just to add a wrapper. But the **real complexity** of `TaskList` component is revealed in the edge cases `withPinnedTasks`, `loading`, and `empty`.

For the loading edge case, we're going to create a new component that will display the correct markup.

Create a new file called `loading-row.hbs` and inside add the following markup:

```handlebars:title=app/components/loading-row.hbs
<div class="loading-item">
  <span class="glow-checkbox" />
  <span class="glow-text">
    <span>Loading</span>
    <span>cool</span>
    <span>state</span>
  </span>
</div>
```

And update `task-list.hbs` to the following:

```handlebars:title=app/components/task-list.hbs
{{#if @loading}}
  <LoadingRow />
  <LoadingRow />
  <LoadingRow/>
  <LoadingRow />
  <LoadingRow />
{{else if this.tasksInOrder}}
  {{#each this.tasksInOrder as |task|}}
    <Task
       @task={{task}}
       @pin={{fn @pinTask task.id}}
       @archive={{fn @archiveTask task.id}}
    />
   {{/each}}
{{else}}
  <div class="list-items">
    <div class="wrapper-message">
      <span class="icon-check" />
      <div class="title-message">You have no tasks</div>
      <div class="subtitle-message">Sit back and relax</div>
    </div>
  </div>
{{/if}}
```

And finally create a new file called `task-list.js` to the following:

```js:title=app/components/task-list.js
import Component from '@glimmer/component';

export default class TaskList extends Component {
  // computed property to arrange the tasks per their state
  get tasksInOrder() {
    return [
      ...this.args.tasks.filter(t => t.state === 'TASK_PINNED'),
      ...this.args.tasks.filter(t => t.state !== 'TASK_PINNED'),
    ];
  }
}
```

The added markup results in the following UI:

<video autoPlay muted playsInline loop>
  <source
    src="/intro-to-storybook/finished-tasklist-states-6-0.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

Note the position of the pinned item in the list. We want the pinned item to render at the top of the list to make it a priority for our users.

## Automated testing

Since `TaskList` adds another layer of complexity we want to verify that certain inputs produce certain outputs in a way amenable to automatic testing. To do this we‚Äôll create unit tests using [Qunit](https://qunitjs.com/) coupled with a test renderer.

![Qunit logo](/intro-to-storybook/logo-qunit.jpg)

### Unit tests with Qunit

Storybook stories paired with manual visual tests go a long way to avoiding UI bugs. If stories cover a wide variety of component use cases, and we use tools that ensure a human checks any change to the story, errors are much less likely.

However, sometimes the devil is in the details. A test framework that is explicit about those details is needed. Which brings us to unit tests.

In our case, we want our `TaskList` to render any pinned tasks **before** unpinned tasks that it has passed in the `tasks` prop. Although we have a story (`WithPinnedTasks`) to test this exact scenario, it can be ambiguous to a human reviewer that if the component **stops** ordering the tasks like this, it is a bug. It certainly won‚Äôt scream **‚ÄúWrong!‚Äù** to the casual eye.

So, to avoid this problem, we can use Qunit to render the component and run some DOM querying code to verify salient features of the output.

Create a test file called `tests/integration/task-list-test.js`. Here, we‚Äôll build out our tests that make assertions about the output.

```js:title=tests/integration/task-list-test.js
import { module, test } from 'qunit';
import { setupRenderingTest } from 'ember-qunit';
import { render } from '@ember/test-helpers';
import { hbs } from 'ember-cli-htmlbars';

module('Integration | Component | TaskList', function(hooks) {
  setupRenderingTest(hooks);
  const taskData = {
    id: '1',
    title: 'Test Task',
    state: 'TASK_INBOX',
    updatedAt: new Date(2018, 0, 1, 9, 0),
  };
  const tasklist = [
    { ...taskData, id: '1', title: 'Task 1' },
    { ...taskData, id: '2', title: 'Task 2' },
    { ...taskData, id: '3', title: 'Task 3' },
    { ...taskData, id: '4', title: 'Task 4' },
    { ...taskData, id: '5', title: 'Task 5' },
    { ...taskData, id: '6', title: 'Task 6 (pinned)', state: 'TASK_PINNED' },
  ];

  test('renders pinned tasks at the start of the list', async function(assert) {
    this.tasks = tasklist;
    await render(hbs`<TaskList @tasks={{this.tasks}}/>`);
    assert.dom('[data-test-task]:nth-of-type(1)').hasClass('TASK_PINNED');
  });
});
```

Contrary to the other versions of this tutorial, with Ember we can't import the data and stories used in our story file created earlier, without introducing a lot of complexity and that's beyond the scope of the tutorial. For now we'll copy over the values used in the story file to help out with our tests.

Notice as well that this test is quite brittle. It's possible that as the project matures, and the exact implementation of the `Task` changes --perhaps using a different classname or a `textarea` rather than an `input`--the test will fail, and need to be updated. This is not necessarily a problem, but rather an indication to be careful about liberally using unit tests for UI. They're not easy to maintain. Instead rely on visual, snapshot, and visual regression (see [testing chapter](/intro-to-storybook/ember/en/test/)) tests where possible.
