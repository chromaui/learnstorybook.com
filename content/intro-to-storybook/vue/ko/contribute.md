Contributions to Storybook's tutorials are encouraged! If it’s something small like grammar or punctuation, open up a pull request. If it’s a bigger change, [add an issue](https://github.com/chromaui/learnstorybook.com/issues) for discussion.

Storybook's tutorials were created and maintained primarily by the community, so we need everyone's help to keep it up to date and ensure any rough edges are smoothed out over time. All help is appreciated!

## Translations

Our goal is to make Storybook approachable to all people. Help translate this tutorial into other languages. We’re especially open to Chinese and Spanish translations. Comment on the [issue here](https://github.com/chromaui/learnstorybook.com/issues/3).
